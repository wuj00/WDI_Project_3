##WDI Project 3: SpotBuds

SpotBuds was created by Lewis Bracey, Nicole Thurnau, and Jennifer Wu as their third project for General Assembly's WDI course in Santa Monica.

###Objective

<insert link> SpotBuds is a social networking site that allows athletes and fitness enthusiasts to find SpotBuds, or people to work out with in their area. Buds can drop Pins on a map to show where they will work out. The Pin contains information about the type of workout the Bud wants to do. Other Buds in the area can click the Pin and find out what types of activities are going on in their area and RSVP to the events! Once a Bud attends they can get a Biceps rating from the event planner. SpotBuds can get together, have fun, and most importantly, Get Pumped!

###Project Requirements

The guidelines listed below were provided by the project markdown:

- User of MongoDB and Express to create data CRUD
- Produce a RESTful API that expresses at least one model
- Consume its own API using AJAX
- Authenticate users using at least one OAuth provider
- Restrict access to the Creation, Updating, and Deletion of resources using an authorization middleware function
- Be deployed online using Heroku

Necessary Deliverables

- A [pitch deck](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s172/sh/63cb39a2-8ccd-4481-8820-86b7f269454d/51ab7a70b0aa0ab124fae56fb3964227), delivered as a team to the instructors
- A working app, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the Internet
- A client application that consumes our own API, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to our hosted, working app in the URL section of our Github repo
- A Git repository hosted on Github, with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A Readme.md file (you are reading that!)

###Wireframes
Please see our team [Trello Board for Project 3](https://trello.com/b/lAAZSSCb/wdi-project-3)'s done column for wireframes.

###Technologies Used
- MongoDB.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- AJAX
- CSS with Bootstrap and Materialize
- HTML5
- JQuery and JavaScript
- APIs listed here

###Approach Taken

- 1) First, we drew out our Wireframes to diagram and plan our project's views
- 2) Second, we made a planning board and wrote user-stories using [our Trello Board for Project 3](https://trello.com/b/lAAZSSCb/wdi-project-3).
- 3) We created models, views, and controllers for our app. We achieved full CRUD using RESTful routing.
- 4) After much debugging, we styled using blahblah and CSS.
